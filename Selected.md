Planet labs

Tile2Vec: Similar location - Similar meaning

What are the sources of data you used for Tile2Vec?

Could Tile2Vec replace supervised learning task such as detecting urban zones ?





# Practical ML for Developing Countries 

### Panel Discussion: on practical issues of AI for developing countries 15:45

With all the big companies with headquarters in developed countries offering promising career opportunities. What can developing countries do to retain talent?

I think there is a challenging gap in bringing ML / DS solutions to non major cities in developing countries. Cities where 90%  of the revenue is based on tourism (restaurants etc.) or other type of commerce where machine can be applied but entrepreneurs are resisting to the shift 

### Measuring changes in poverty with dl and satellite imagery 17:05

### Lessons learned 

Speaking about masters programs. With the exponential growth of 

With the exponential growth of programs in data analytics. One can doubt the quality of the content. Is there a potential risk on educating data scientists lacking the focus in insights and more on training open the latest libraries?
