# Computer vision problems. Image segmentation

- U-net very good baseline
- We have public datasets. How de we measure with our own?
- What is out datset of test out case?
- Metric: Intersection over Union (Jaccard Index)
- Cyclic Learning rate ¿?
- Optimizer: Adam
- Batch size: 4 ¿?
- Loss:
  - Binary crossentropy for binary classification
  - BC: predicts the probability 
  - We want masks: [0,1]
  - DICE
  - SOFT DICE
- Pseudo Labeling:
