I've noticed that Causal Inference lacks Research content. May I suggest the work of Judea Pearl, also Joshua Bengio wants to evolve Deep Learning into causality. Conclusion I drawn based on his latest talk on NeuroIPS "From System 1 to System 2". Also there is a facinanting discussion or in other words "battle" that states ML. is only curve fitting and  real AI have to have causality emmbeded. There are facinninating twitter threads about it, Mostly discussions between Judea Pearl and Yan Le Cunn

I cannot love more this statement. I often hear the best method to learn is to work with your own project and ideas. With no doubt this is true, but sometimes and I mean very often, learners do not have time or simply do not have ideas for a project due to real-lfe issues, (large working hours, other hobbies, leisure activities, spending time with loved ones). 

What I'm seeing, is a platform that compiles projects from top practitioners accompanied with all tools necessary for a successful reimplementation (articles, papers, blogs, code, author contact). 

I can backup this view with one of MWML's core vision:

What would be really inspiring is to find successfull histories about completed implementations in any of these projects found in the platform. In my personal opinion is what Fast AI is doing really well, empowering students and showing up their work based on its teaching content. This gives the idea of reducing the breach of ML and actually make ML  accessible for anyone.

Reimplementation is not an easy thing. Some resources are more reproducible than others. In fact Papers with code has compiled a series of checklist that make a project truly reproducible and now they have become the official format of NeurIPS 2020. 

There are many  bumps in the road when it comes to reimplement others people's work. From setting up the right environment, compute resources, lack of information regarding the logic fo the code, communication issues with the author, etc.

A general guideline form on how to reimplement would be amazing. Perhaps a structure that tells you the common obstacles you may find and how to solve it.

[^1]: Generative Adversarial Networks Topic experts

I've noticed the "Topic experts" feature and I loved it. Nevertheless I couldn't help to think of Ian Goodfellow on this example, then I realized this are all members of MWML. For a completely new user perspective, browsing through this site might become a bit unfamiliar. 

Perhaps a more accurate name would be "Community experts"?

Of course there is no doubt about his expertise once you browse through his profile and see all the projects and professional credentials.

I find this feature <u>**game changing**</u>. It makes me feel like I'm contruibuiting with the community. Not only you can upload your own projects but you can share valuable resources you have used in the past and give them visibility. 

I often want to show my  apreciation with regards of the many resource I've used and how they have helped me in my career.

​															*Fig 7: Form of Suggest a Resource*



A few thoughts on figure 7. 

-  About the tagging the author. It is pretty much mandatory to give ownership to the author :)
  - Does the author recives some sort of notification when you tag them? It would be cool if it did ;)
  - Date completed: Official release date?, Date when I discovered it?
  - Objectives & Highlights: "1-3 objectives and highlights of your project"
